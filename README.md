## 🧑‍💼 Professional Summary

A seasoned professional with a solid track record in software development, technology architecture, and business leadership. Extensive experience in digital platform design, e-commerce, fintech, reservation systems, and integration solutions. Proven ability to lead complex end-to-end projects, from product conception to production deployment. Founder of multiple startups and specialist in creating scalable, secure, and business-oriented solutions.

From the moment I first discovered computers, my passion for technology grew into a lifelong pursuit of understanding how things work and creating software that solves real problems. Growing up in Cuba, where access to computers, the internet, and modern technologies was restricted and sometimes penalized, only strengthened my determination. In an environment with limited resources and opportunities, only the most dedicated and talented individuals could develop advanced technical skills. Despite these challenges, I persisted, learning independently and building my career through discipline, curiosity, and a deep desire to innovate. Limited professional opportunities in the country further motivated me to pursue excellence on a global scale.
